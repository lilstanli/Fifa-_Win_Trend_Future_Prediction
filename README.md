FIFA Winning Team Prediction System

In this sports analytics project idea, the Random Forest machine learning algorithm will be used to predict the number of goals a specific team will likely score during a FIFA World Cup game. To train the model, data from the World Cup from 2002 through 2014 will be used. To begin the model-building phase, various variables, such as economic data like the nation's GDP will be employed. The FIFA rating, average team age, number of Champions League players, home advantage, etc., are additional variables that will help model training.
